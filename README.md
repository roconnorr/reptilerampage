fitting them with huge guns, in this twin stick shoot em up, slay hordes of
weaponized dinos and stop the madman Gavin before he takes over the world!

CONTROLS
--------

 * WASD 					      = Move
 * Mouse 					      = Aim
 * Left Click 				  = Shoot
 * Right Click / G 		  = Grenade
 * E 						        = Pick up Weapon
 * Tab / Scroll / 1,2,3 = Swap weapon

KNOWN ISSUES
------------ 

- Safari may heavily compress audio quality
- Firefox may sometimes cause issues with right clicking?

To get the WebGL build to run smoothly we've had to compress a lot of textures
and sounds which ruins a lot of sprites.
If you have any issues with performance or want the game to be the best quality we 
recommend downloading a build here:
